## Generation Tips:

1. **Use these prompts individually** for each chakra to maintain consistency
2. **Specify "transparent background"** multiple times if needed
3. **Request PNG format** explicitly
4. **Ask for "professional wellness aesthetic"** to match your target audience
5. **Emphasize "clean, minimalist design"** to avoid cluttered results
6. **Include "sacred geometry"** for authentic spiritual symbolism

## Post-Generation:
- Save each image with the exact filename: `root.png`, `sacral.png`, `solar.png`, `heart.png`, `throat.png`, `third-eye.png`, `crown.png`
- Ensure all images are square format and high resolution
- Check that backgrounds are transparent
- Verify Sanskrit characters are clearly visible and correctly rendered
